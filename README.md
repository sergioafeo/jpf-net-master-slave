# jpf-net-master-slave
An extension to Java Pathfinder to perform distributed model checking.

This project is the initial implementation of an extensoin that allows connecting two JPF model checker instances via a virtualized network layer to explore the state space of the 'master' instance based on a state space search for network inputs and responses of the 'slave' instance.
